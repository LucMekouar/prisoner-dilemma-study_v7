<h3>Study Aims</h3>
<p>The purpose of this research is to better understand the role of communication in cooperation between human and machines.</p>

<p>In this study, you were asked to play a cooperation game with a bot over 30 iterations.</p>

<p>You may or may not have had the ability to communicate with your partner: send pre-written messages to your partner bot who answered with prewritten messages too.</p>

<p>This experiment included a small amount of deceptions as you were not told that the actions of the bot were independent of the messages you sent them (if you could communicate). Informing you of that would have disincentivized you to communicate, leading to inconclusive results.</p>

<p>The results from this study will help scientists better understand how humans interact and cooperate with machines. This is important to make sure the potential deployment of digital agents in society is done in a safe and beneficial way.</p>
