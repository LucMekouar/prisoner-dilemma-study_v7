<p><strong>Study title:</strong> Playing a Cooperation/Defection game with a Partner Online<br>
<strong>Name of Researcher:</strong> Luc Mekouar<br>
<strong>Name of Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Maria Robinson</p>

<p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in this research study! This research study is on understanding human cooperation in a digital setting. You will be asked to play the game of prisoner’s dilemma with a provided partner over multiple rounds. The rules will be clearly stated before the game begins, and you will have the opportunity to practice.</p>

<p><strong>You must be over the age of 18 to take part.</strong></p>

<p>You will also be asked to report demographic information (gender and age) to allow us to understand our sample better and determine the generalizability of the findings.</p>

<p>The experiment should take about 15 minutes to complete. You will be playing with a partner multiple rounds. Each round, you and your partner each will be able to either cooperate or defect, after which you and your partner will receive in-game reward (fictional), where the amount depends on both you and your partner’s decision in that round.</p>

<p>At the end of the survey, you will have the option to enter a prize draw to win an amazon voucher worth £20. Please note that to enter the draw you must provide your email address. However, please note that this information will not be connected to your study responses. The prize draw will take place on the 24th of February, after which your email will be deleted.</p>
